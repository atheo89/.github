### Welcome to Open Data Hub 
Open Data Hub (ODH) is an open source project based on Kubeflow that provides open source AI tools for running large and distributed AI workloads on OpenShift Container Platform. Currently, the Open Data Hub project provides open source tools for data storage, distributed AI and Machine Learning (ML) workflows, Jupyter Notebook development environment and monitoring. 

#### Benefits of Open Data Hub 

ODH is a meta-project that integrates open source projects into a practical solution. It aims to foster collaboration between communities, vendors, user-enterprises, and academics following open source best practices. The open source community can experiment and develop intelligent applications without incurring high costs and having to master the complexity of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence software stacks.
